* Design Components

** Resources to Expose
Design the resources that will be exposed via the MCP protocol.
- org-autotask-mcp-files: Safe subset of user agenda files
- Project-centric organization
- Task representation
- Session-specific project scope
- TODO: Add path canonicalization to ensure consistent path formats for file paths

** Tools to Implement
Define the tools that will be provided for task management.
- [X] First tool: "list-available-org-files" to return org-autotask-mcp-files
  - Agent will use a subset of these files in subsequent requests
- [X] Second tool: "get-org-file-content" to return content of a requested org file

** MCP Protocol Implementation
Plan the implementation of the MCP server and protocol handling.

** Emacs/Org-mode Integration
Design the integration with Emacs and Org-mode functionality.
